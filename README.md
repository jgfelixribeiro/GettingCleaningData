Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

To run the script file `run_analysis.R` you will need the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The script will start reading the text files.
After, the script will rename the columns of data frame and will make a merge with training and test set.
With the merge set, the script will pick up only de mean and deviation columns.
After, the script will rename the columns and finish generating the tidy data.
